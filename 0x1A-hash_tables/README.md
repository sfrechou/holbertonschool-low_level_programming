# 0x1A. C - Hash tables
## Resources
Read or watch:
* [What is a HashTable Data Structure - Introduction to Hash Tables , Part 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfhjkfocRR0)
* [Hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)
* [Hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
* What is a hash function
* What makes a good hash function
* What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them
* What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table
* What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
* What are the most common use cases of hash tables

## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are allowed to use the C standard library
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called hash_tables.h
* Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded

## More Info
### Data Structures
Please use these data structures for this project:
```
/**
 * struct hash_node_s - Node of a hash table
 *
 * @key: The key, string
 * The key is unique in the HashTable
 * @value: The value corresponding to a key
 * @next: A pointer to the next node of the List
 */
typedef struct hash_node_s
{
     char *key;
     char *value;
     struct hash_node_s *next;
} hash_node_t;

/**
 * struct hash_table_s - Hash table data structure
 *
 * @size: The size of the array
 * @array: An array of size @size
 * Each cell of this array is a pointer to the first node of a linked list,
 * because we want our HashTable to use a Chaining collision handling
 */
typedef struct hash_table_s
{
     unsigned long int size;
     hash_node_t **array;
} hash_table_t;
```
## Tasks
0. >>> ht = {} mandatory
Write a function that creates a hash table.

* Prototype: hash_table_t *hash_table_create(unsigned long int size);
    - where size is the size of the array
* Returns a pointer to the newly created hash table
* If something went wrong, your function should return NULL
